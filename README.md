🌍 Srinivasan Mani
Geospatial Data Engineer | GNSS | Space Weather | Python & PostGIS








👋 About Me

I work in geospatial engineering with a focus on GNSS data, space weather, and large-scale spatial analytics.
Most of my work revolves around building tools and pipelines that make scientific geospatial datasets easier to understand - from ionospheric visualizations to high-performance ETL systems and OGC-compliant services.

I enjoy the whole workflow: collecting, processing, storing, visualizing, and serving geospatial data in clean, reusable ways.

🚀 What I Work On

GNSS data processing: scintillation, TEC, electron density

Python-based ETL pipelines for large geospatial datasets

PostGIS database design and optimization

OGC-compliant web services using GeoServer & Docker

Earth observation workflows with Sentinel & Google Earth Engine

3D visualization tools using Plotly, Marimo, QGIS

Spatial analytics for navigation and routing systems

🛰️ Experience
