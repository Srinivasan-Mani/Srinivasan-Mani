🎨 About Me

I work in geospatial engineering with a focus on GNSS, space weather, and large geospatial datasets.
My interest is in building tools that make scientific data easier to explore. That includes 3D ionospheric visualizations, spatial data pipelines, and OGC compliant services.

I enjoy taking a dataset from the raw stage all the way to an interactive and accessible product.
Data → Processing → Visualization → Deployment.

🚀 What I Focus On

GNSS data processing including TEC, scintillation, and electron density

Python based ETL pipelines for high volume spatial data

Spatial database design and optimization with PostGIS

GeoServer and Docker based OGC services

Earth observation analysis with Sentinel 2 and Google Earth Engine

Interactive mapping and 3D visualization using Plotly, Marimo, and QGIS

Spatial analytics for navigation and routing systems
